# Nameless
A three.js experiment


This project tend to construct a navigable world in three dimensions. This world is comparable to a piece of art. Each user is an artisan. Everyone contributes to construct this world by the way of the discussion.

By this way, we build the mapping of a virtual discussions network.

The black shape allows you to log out from this world. If you want to interact with a shape, you just have to click on it.
